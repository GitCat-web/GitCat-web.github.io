## About Me

A student in high school doing a final project for a computer programming class.

## About My Project

I want to create a simple higher or lower game where a user can interact with a GUI in Google Colab and guess if a randomly generated number from 1-10 will be higher or lower than the previously generated value. I chose this idea because, when working with the random module in this class, I remembered an old higher or lower minigame I used to play as a kid. It would incorporate many elements from this class like the random module and conditional statements, along with exploring some new things we did not cover in class like making GUI's in Colab. To implement this, I have done some base-level research into Google Colab's GUIs and believe I can accomplish this task if I follow these steps: 1. research phase (learn how to build a GUI and how to connect it to the code), 2. code the inner workings of the game (random number, determining if said number is higher or lower, streak count, etc), and 3. implement a GUI to interact with the previously written code. The first step should be simple enough with everything we learned in class, however, I will have to read the documentation for GUI making. The second and third steps will be far simpler as I will know what I need to do and just have to do it. I plan to give my first step half a week and then spend 3/4 of a week on my last two steps.
