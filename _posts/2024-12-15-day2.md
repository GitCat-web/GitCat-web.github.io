title: Day 2

Today, I aimed to get the basic game in a functional state by completing my first two goals from last time (1. code functions for if either button was pressed, and 2. create a function for the core of the game and the buttons to be stored in). Due to my prior preparation, I managed to get the game into a functional state with only a bit of trial and error. I did so by simply putting it all under one function (except for my global variables)--play_game()--with two subfunctions of higher() and lower(). I had to make these two subfunctions because even with the global variables, I kept running into issues with assignments, specifically with variables being called before their assignment and values being changed at the wrong times. Hence, I altered my model a bit to use local variables when possible, fixing my aforementioned issues. With the preparation I did, I was pretty annoyed when I still had issues with variable assignments, however, this feeling eventually turned to joy when I managed to solve my problems and got it working. Leaving on a good note again makes me excited to pick this project back up in the coming days. In said days I expect to code in some additional features like improving the efficiency of the code, along with adding features such as a win/loss counter, improved usability, and maybe more (if I have time).
