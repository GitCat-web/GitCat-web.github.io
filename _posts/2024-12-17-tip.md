A piece of advice I would offer anyone taking this class is to start on the missions and such early enough to where you can go think on it for a while. I say this because I remember many times when I could not figure out a problem until I looked at it a few times. Also, make sure to get a solid grasp of the basics and understanding of how Python works as, just like when speaking a language, it is impossible to effectively communicate your ideas if you do not understand the basis of said language. Overall, just put a decent amount of effort in and you will not only do great but learn a lot in the process.
